# Heat Treatment of Mild Steel – MM208 Lab Report

This repository contains a detailed lab report for the **Phase Transformation and Heat Treatment Lab (MM208)** course. The experiment involved subjecting mild steel samples to different heat treatment processes—**Annealing, Quenching, and Normalising**—to study the effects on microstructure and hardness.

 Objective

To analyze the effects of various heat treatment techniques on the microstructure and mechanical properties (hardness) of mild steel.

## Heat Treatment Methods Performed

- **Annealing** – Slow cooling in furnace to reduce hardness and improve ductility.
- **Quenching** – Rapid cooling in water to form martensite for increased hardness.
- **Normalising** – Air cooling to refine grain structure and improve toughness.

## Procedure Summary

1. Heated samples to **1100°C** in a furnace.
2. Applied different cooling techniques to 3 samples.
3. Performed polishing, etching (5% Nital), and microstructural analysis using an optical microscope.
4. Conducted Vickers hardness testing on all samples.

## Material Used

- Mild Steel (0.05% - 0.25% Carbon)

## Results Summary

- **Annealed Sample**: Coarse ferrite grains, hardness ~212 HV
- **Normalised Sample**: Finer ferrite/pearlite grains, hardness ~238 HV
- **Quenched Sample**: Martensitic structure, hardness ~450.66 HV

## Key Observations

- Hardness increases with faster cooling.
- Microstructure evolves from ferrite/pearlite to martensite.
- Ductility is highest in annealed sample, lowest in quenched.
